## 🌟 What is SnapFlow?

**SnapFlow** combines the power and stability of `yt-dlp` with the iconic, clean, and modern UI/UX of **Snaptube**:
- 🎨 **Signature Snaptube Aesthetic:** Vibrant warm yellow accents (`#FFB800`), deep matte dark background (`#121212`), rounded cards, and category tabs.
- 📱 **Floating Format Selector:** Non-full-width floating card dialog for downloading videos and audio with clear format and file size badges.
- 🚀 **Zero-Touch Core Engine:** 100% of the internal `yt-dlp` download logic, services, database, and background workers remain strictly preserved to guarantee zero regressions or bugs.
- ⚡ **Silky Smooth Animations:** Launch transition with logo pulse/scale reveal.
- 🤖 **Zero-Setup GitHub Actions CI:** Build and download signed APKs directly from GitHub without needing Android Studio installed locally!

2. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository.
3. Click on **Android CI** and click **Run workflow** (or simply push any commit).
4. GitHub will automatically compile the APKs (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `universal`, etc.).
5. Download the `.apk` from the **Artifacts** section at the bottom of the run, and install it on your device!
